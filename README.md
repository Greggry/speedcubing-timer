# speedcubing-timer
This is a timer made for speedcubers to track their solve times.

The project was made with vanilla JS, that's because I wanted to practice using Javascript DOM.
The first version of this project was uploaded on codepen.io/greggry/pen/zYGKyXE.
I uploaded it to github because I wanted to track changes, I am planning on modifying this project from time to time.
